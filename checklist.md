### MBB ETF Data Integration
- [x] Test fetch_mbb_data() function with a sample date
- [x] Verify Yahoo Finance data is properly parsed and transformed
- [x] Check that data collection includes prepost market data

### Data Validation & Anomaly Detection
- [x] Verify volume validation is functioning via validate_volume()
- [x] Test with intentionally abnormal data to confirm detection
- [x] Confirm time continuity validation with validate_time_continuity()

### Data Storage
- [x] Verify database connection checks are implemented
- [x] Confirm duplicate handling works correctly
- [x] Check data retention policy functionality in data_retention.py

## Calculation Engine
### Buydown Cost Calculation
- [x] Test with sample MBS prices to verify cost formula works
- [x] Confirm calculation works across various coupon rate pairs

### Monthly Savings Calculation
- [x] Verify monthly payment calculations match expected values
- [x] Test with different loan amounts and interest rates
- [x] Confirm calculation of monthly savings between rates

### ROI Calculation
- [x] Verify ROI and breakeven calculations
- [x] Test edge cases (zero cost, negative savings)
- [x] Check that results are stored correctly

### Incremental Analysis
- [x] Confirm 10 bps increment analysis is functioning
- [x] Verify calculations between all valid rate pairs

- [ ] Verify scheduled data update jobs
- [ ] Test error handling and recovery

## Testing & Non-Functional Requirements
### Performance Testing
- [ ] Verify data retrieval and calculations complete under 1 minute
- [ ] Test with larger datasets to ensure scalability

### Data Validation
- [ ] Test with synthetic data per section 11.4 of PRD
- [ ] Verify visualization features with test dataset

### Security & Reliability
- [ ] Check API key management via .env for Gemini API
- [ ] Verify error handling in daily_update.py
- [ ] Test recovery from failed data retrieval attempts

### Environment Validation
- [ ] Verify database connection checks
- [ ] Test API key validation
- [ ] Confirm calculation thresholds are properly implemented

## Final Verification
### End-to-End Testing
- [ ] Run complete workflow from data retrieval to visualization
- [ ] Verify all components work together correctly
- [ ] Check that ROI calculations match expected values for known scenarios
